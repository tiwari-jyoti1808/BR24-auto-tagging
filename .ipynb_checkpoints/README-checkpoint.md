# BR24-auto-tagging

BR24 is an online German news platform, which has a collection of approx. 40,000 manually tagged articles. For a large scale news broadcaster like BR24, operating with a small team of editors, manually tagging hundreds of articles on a daily basis is a cumbersome and tedious overhead. Auto tagging will help reduce the time and effort required to publish articles, as well as, streamline the entire process of tag selection.

Here, we aim to build an auto-tagging service which can be incorporated in the BR24 content management system (CMS). 

/auto-tagging/ contains the source code for the service

/notebooks/ contains all jupyter notebboks in a numbered format. The numbers represents the order in which they can be followed. Each notebook works on a .pkl data file and saves the results to a different .pkl file, names are mentioned in the notebooks.

/data/ all data required for performing experiments and evaluating results are placed in this folder. 

Follow the below steps to install and execute the auto-tagging service:
